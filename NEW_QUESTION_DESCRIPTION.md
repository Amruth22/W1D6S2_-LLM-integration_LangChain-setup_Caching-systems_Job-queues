# LLM Integration with LangChain, Caching Systems, and Job Queues - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive LLM API system that demonstrates advanced Large Language Model integration using LangChain, intelligent caching systems, and asynchronous job queue processing with FastAPI. This project focuses on implementing production-ready LLM orchestration with Google Gemini AI, LRU caching for performance optimization, and Celery-based job queues for handling long-running AI generation tasks in scalable applications.

## Project Objectives

1. **LangChain Integration:** Master LangChain framework for LLM orchestration including prompt templates, chain composition, response parsing, and advanced AI workflow management for production applications.

2. **Intelligent Caching Systems:** Implement high-performance LRU (Least Recently Used) caching using functools.lru_cache to optimize LLM response times and reduce API costs through intelligent response caching.

3. **Asynchronous Job Queue Processing:** Design and implement Celery-based job queue systems with in-memory brokers for handling long-running LLM generation tasks without blocking API responses.

4. **Google Gemini AI Integration:** Build robust integration with Google's Gemini AI models including proper API key management, error handling, and response processing for enterprise-grade applications.

5. **Performance Optimization:** Create high-performance API systems that handle both synchronous and asynchronous LLM requests with intelligent caching and queue management for optimal user experience.

6. **Production-Ready Architecture:** Implement scalable LLM API architecture with proper configuration management, error handling, and monitoring capabilities suitable for production deployment.
